Sample Architecture 2

**Kubernetes** 
is  an opensource container orchestration tool.
1.  It helps us manage thousands of containerized applications.
2. It helps us to manage thousands of containers in different environments. (local, hybrid, cloud, vms, etc.) 

**Use Cases**
- The rise of microservices raise the usage of containers.(container technology).
- K8s is a way of managing thousands of containers.
- Instead of running VMs, K8s helps to reduce costs on EC2 instances, to better make use of the provisioned services. 
- K8s supports high availability, no downtime, because of certain features that can let you design a robust infrastructure.
- Scalability , you can scale up and down your resources, since you can replicate your nodes easily.

# ðŸ’ŽMain K8s components
## POD
- smallest unit of K8s
- abstraction over container ( Pod is an abstraction over container runtime like containerd):

- An app is running over a containerized environment.
- An app is running over ~~a containerized environment~~ a pod.
- Usually there is 1 application per pod. Check for best practice here; https://www.bmc.com/blogs/kubernetes-best-practices/
- **A pod is a collection of applications and volumes which share one ip address where each of the containerized application can share the same port space of that single IP: This also enable pod to connect with other pods because of the provided IP.**

## ðŸš§ Warning / Pitfalls
- When a pod dies, it will have a new IP uon recreation (ephemeral) 
- So a service is needed ( a permanent IP/address).
## Services and Ingress
- permanent address
- pods will communicate with each other via a service.
- An ingress works like a reverse proxy and much more way to route traffic to the nodes. ? Can it route traffic directly to pods too? Technically yes since when you access an app via node, you access them via the app port of the node's IP.
## ConfigMap and Secret
Back then:
1. If you wanna change a url, you need to rebuild it. (e.g. docker build)

- Configmap - is an external configuration of an application 
- If your URL changed, just edit the config map, no need to rebuild the application.
From:
```
DB_URL = mongo_db ---> DB_URL = mongodb_url_service
```
- Tokens and Secrets CAN be passed to the ConfigMap too, but that pose a risk, in that case, one needs to make use of a SECRET.
- SECRET is where all the credentials are stored, it can be integrated with third party tool. ( Example, integrating Kubernetes Secret to hashicorp vault, or any other credentials manager).
- It is used for storing secret data and base 64 encoded.
- You can pass variables there as properties file or as an environmental variable. 

## Volumes
![](https://www.learncloudnative.com/assets/posts/img/volumes-1.png)
Back then, if a pod restarts then all your data will be gone.
- To address this concern you need to attach a volume to your pod.
- The volume can be coming from your local zone or remote.
!!! Kubernetes doesn't help you manage data persistence, it is just there to help you set it up, your data persistence. That's why it offers configuration that'll get you started.

## Deployment and Stateful Set
= Creating a Blueprint

USE CASE:
```
When there is an expected or unexpected downtime -- it will jeopardize the business.
```
You can replicate a node, so that the services that isn't working will be redirect to the working node. 
Of which a service can act as a load balance, and a permanent IP as well. 
<br>
To create a replica of a node, you need to define a blueprint of it. It is a concept in K8s called **Deployment**.
In deployment you can scale up and down. <br>
**Deployment** is an abstration on top of pods.
